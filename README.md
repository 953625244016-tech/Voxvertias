🛡️ AI-Generated Voice Detection System
Cross-Language Deepfake Audio Classifier (Multi-Lingual)
This production-ready system detects whether an audio sample is generated by AI (Synthetic) or a real Human voice. It is specifically designed to handle the nuances of five major languages: Tamil, English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Telugu.


🚀 Key Features
Deep Learning Core: Uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch.
Advanced Audio Processing: Converts raw audio into Log-Mel Spectrograms to detect synthetic frequency artifacts.
Modular Architecture: Professional separation of concerns (API, Services, ML Models, Frontend).
Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit for real-time file uploads and detection history.
REST API: High-performance FastAPI backend with Base64 support.
Language Agnostic: Analyzes acoustic textures rather than words, making it effective across different languages.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.10+
Machine Learning: PyTorch, Librosa (Audio Analysis)
Backend: FastAPI, Uvicorn
Frontend: Streamlit
Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas
Environment: Docker, Virtual Environments

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher
FFmpeg (Required for audio processing)
Windows: choco install ffmpeg or download from ffmpeg.org
Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg

2. Environment Setup
code
Bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Initialize/Train the Model
Place your audio samples in data/train/human and data/train/ai, then run:
code
Bash
python train.py
🏃 How to Run

🧠 ML Pipeline Explanation
Preprocessing: Audio is resampled to 16kHz and standardized to a 4-second duration.
Feature Extraction: Time-domain signals are converted to 2D Mel-Spectrogram images (128 frequency bands).
Inference: A CNN model analyzes the spectrogram. AI voices often leave "checkerboard" artifacts or overly smooth frequency lines which the model identifies.
Output: A Softmax layer provides the final probability score between 0 and 1.
